Qube Bridge Contracts


## Notice
QubeBridge is a Secure Custom Private Bridge operated by Mabble Protocol
used solely by QubeSwap Dex for its users to Bridge Assets and Trade.
The Bridge work flow relied on a Backend Processor Server off-chain 
validation and a multisig for admin operations.



## QubeBridge | To Do Next
Switch to a more Decentralized Bridge approach
with features like:
-Governor DAO Manager along with a Multi-sig Timelock
-On-chain transactions verification
-A cross-chain messaging system no external processor
-and more ...
